In this post, my aims are:

- Introduce Bayesian inference in state space models
- Introduce approximate inference using importance sampling, in state space models. I will try to present and compare different ways of deriving the algorithms that I found in the literature, trying to unify them in a way that I have not seen explicitly elsewhere.
- Finally, describe the Auxiliary Particle Filter, its diverse intepretations and the recent Improved Auxiliary Particle Filter by Elvira et al [1]. I will illustrate the IAPF by reproducing the results of Elvira et al. [3].
