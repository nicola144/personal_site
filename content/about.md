This very infrequent blog is by me, <span style="color:#ff5a33"> **Nicola Branchini**</span>.  
I am a graduate researcher in Statistics in the [School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/research/data-decisions/statistics/stats-people), advised by [Dr. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/). 
The kind of research I (mostly) enjoy doing is the so called ["fundamental" or "basic" research](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/here-s-why-fund-fundamental-scientific-research-davos2023/). To be clear, it does not mean it is "better" or "more important" (nor less, for that matter) than other kinds of research. 

 <img src="Nicola_Branchini.png" align="left" width="200" height="auto" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 50px"> <p> I am interested broadly in  <b style="color:#00FF00"> <i> statistical methodology </i></b> surrounding efficient uncertainty quantification, decision making, probabilistic reasoning, computational statistics, and machine learning. <br> More specifically, I am interested in methods for (possibly adaptive) Importance Sampling, experimental design, and causal inference.
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

I like collaborating with people. If you do research in very related topics, feel free to drop me an email.
Some specific topics I am working on now directly and/or want to use in my work in the future are:
<ul style="line-height:1">
  <li> <b style="color:#00FF00"> <i>Importance sampling</i></b> and <b style="color:#00FF00"> <i>quasi Monte Carlo</i></b> methodology for joint estimation of multiple related quantities. </li>
    <li> <b style="color:#00FF00"> <i>Measure transport</i></b> and <b style="color:#00FF00"> <i>optimal transport</i></b> methodology </li>
  <li> <b style="color:#00FF00"> Applications in <i> rare event </i></b> estimation. </li>
  <li> Applications in causal inference, in particular methods to <b style="color:#00FF00"> <i> combine interventional and observational data </i></b> to make sample-efficient inferences in causal models. </li>
</ul>

### Some background

Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the [Alan Turing Institute]( https://www.turing.ac.uk/), working within the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/) and supervised by [Prof. Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas). Previous to that, I was a Master's student in the [School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) where I was supervised by [Dr. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/) working on auxiliary particle filters.
As undergrad, I studied Computer Science at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), where I did my BSc dissertation on reproducing AlphaZero supervised by [Dr. Paolo Turrini](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~pturrini/).
