This very infrequent blog is by me, <span style="color:#ff5a33"> **Nicola Branchini**</span>.  
I am PhD student in Statistics in the [School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/research/data-decisions/statistics/stats-people), advised by [Dr. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/).

 <img src="Nicola_Branchini.png" align="left" width="250" height="auto" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 50px"> <p> I am interested broadly in Statistics and its applications to Machine Learning. My interests are broadly around (possibly adaptive) Importance Sampling, experimental design, and causal inference.

I like collaborating with people. If you do research in very related topics, feel free to drop me an email.
Some topics I am exploring now are:
<ul>
  <li> <i>Importance Sampling</i> schemes for joint estimation of multiple quantities. </li>
  <li>Methods of fusion of interventional and observational data for efficient <i>causal estimation</i>. </li>
  <li>Adaptation schemes for particle filters proposals. </li>
  <li> Effective sample size - like metrics for importance sampling and/or particle filtering. </li>
</ul>

  In this paper we wanted to improve on the Auxiliary Particle Filter (APF), which is thought for estimating the likelihood in sequential latent variable models with very informative observations. This algorithm however still has severe drawbacks; among some, the resampling weights are chosen independently, i.e. each particle chooses its own without "knowing" what the others are doing.
  We devise a new way to optimize these resampling weights by viewing them as mixture weights of an importance sampling mixture proposal. It turns out that choosing mixture weights in order to minimize the resulting empirical variance of the importance weights leads to a convex optimization problem.

### Some background

Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the [Alan Turing Institute]( https://www.turing.ac.uk/), working within the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/) and supervised by [Prof. Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas). Previous to that, I was a Master's student in the [School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) where I was supervised by [Dr. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/) working on auxiliary particle filters.
As undergrad, I studied Computer Science at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), where I did my BSc dissertation on reproducing AlphaZero supervised by [Dr. Paolo Turrini](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~pturrini/).
