  In this paper we wanted to improve on the Auxiliary Particle Filter (APF), which is thought for estimating the likelihood in sequential latent variable models with very informative observations. This algorithm however still has severe drawbacks; among some, the resampling weights are chosen independently, i.e. each particle chooses its own without "knowing" what the others are doing.
  We devise a new way to optimize these resampling weights by viewing them as mixture weights of an importance sampling mixture proposal. It turns out that choosing mixture weights in order to minimize the resulting empirical variance of the importance weights leads to a convex optimization problem.
