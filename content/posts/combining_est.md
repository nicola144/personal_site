I came across this 1.25 page paper by Don Rubin and Sanford Weisberg [(Rubin \& Weisberg)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/62/3/708/257707) in Biometrika from 1975.
It considers the problem of finding the "best" linear combination of $K$ estimators of the *same* quantity. The estimators are all assumed to be unbiased. I think this is still a very much relevant topic; however, I won't try to convince you of this, because I want to keep this short. 
If anything, it can definitely be seen as a nice exercise.

We let $\tau$ be the true, unknown quantity of interest. Estimators of $\tau$ will just be sub-indexed, as $\tau_1,\dots,\tau_K$
