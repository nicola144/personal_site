This very infrequent blog is by me, <span style="color:#ff5a33"> **Nicola Branchini**</span>.  
I am a graduate researcher in Statistics in the [School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/research/data-decisions/statistics/stats-people), advised by [Dr. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/).

 <img src="Nicola_Branchini.png" align="left" width="200" height="auto" style="vertical-align:middle;margin:0px 50px"> <p> I am interested broadly in most methodology surrounding efficient uncertainty quantification, statistical decision making, and probabilistic reasoning. More specifically, I am interested in methods for (possibly adaptive) Importance Sampling, experimental design, and causal inference.

I like collaborating with people. If you do research in very related topics, feel free to drop me an email.
Some topics I am exploring now are:
<ul>
  <li> <i>Importance Sampling</i> schemes for joint estimation of multiple related quantities. </li>
  <li>Methods of fusion of interventional and observational data for efficient <i>causal estimation</i>. </li>
  <li> Effective sample size - like metrics for importance sampling and/or particle filtering. </li>
</ul>

### Some background

Previously, I was a Research Assistant at the [Alan Turing Institute]( https://www.turing.ac.uk/), working within the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/) and supervised by [Prof. Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas). Previous to that, I was a Master's student in the [School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) where I was supervised by [Dr. Víctor Elvira](https://victorelvira.github.io/) working on auxiliary particle filters.
As undergrad, I studied Computer Science at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), where I did my BSc dissertation on reproducing AlphaZero supervised by [Dr. Paolo Turrini](https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~pturrini/).
